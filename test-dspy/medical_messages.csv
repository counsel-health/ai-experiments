My husband always thought my disorientation issues were caused by a demonstration at my dine bday party where I was purposely dropped onto a trampoline (and immediately caught by the guy doing the demo…like a big bounce, which I had agreed to).  That night when I was uploading pics of the birthday party , it struck me very badly (to the point  where I couldnt see my newborn and my 3 year old for 6 weeks…couldn’t work for 8 months, etc.).  I always dismissed the trampoline drop as the trigger cuz it was just one big bounce…I was mostly healthy at the time, and it felt like no big deal. \\n\\n I eventually successfully managed the vertigo up until the pandemic…so my main reason for asking you is because (1) it’ll be nice to finally have a name to something I’ve been dealing with for 13 years; (2) if there are new ways that are better than my own DIY hacks of managing it, I might want to look into trying it.  But mainly a medical name to it…like when I finally got diagnosed with fibromyalgia, it was nice to have a label.

I don\u2019t have my test results yet, I\u2019ll probably receive in the mail or maybe in mychart shortly, and I can send to you.  \\n\\nWhen I first got diagnosed with NAFLD, I was very active\u2026I\u2019m an avid dancer (danced 4-5 hrs\/wk)  and boxer (2-4hrs\/wk) and did strength training to support my 2 loves\u2026and do loosely follow a Mediterranean type diet\u2026I was told not to try to lose weight b\/c being underweight could lead to other health issues.  This time around, I know I\u2019m not getting enough activity because of my struggles w\/exhaustion, migraines, muscle pain, and now painful wrist\u2026so I\u2019ll try to get my act together and incorporate more.  I have started Pilates and doing a little dancing ~an hour a week (at a much lighter intensity , as I can\u2019t do the performance-level stuff right now due to body pain and lower stamina).  In addition to increasing exercise, do you think I need to reduce caloric n intake to lose weight?  Even though I\u2019m heavier now than I was 14 years ago, my weight doesn\u2019t fluctuate and I still wear a size 2 (not sure if you know women\u2019s sizes) , I\u2019m just heavier but no belly fat type stuff that seems to be health issue stuff.",

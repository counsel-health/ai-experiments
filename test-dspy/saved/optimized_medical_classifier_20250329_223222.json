Ive never counted calories in my life\u2026I try not to overthink that stuff and just focus on clean eating, stopping when I\u2019m full, and I don\u2019t deprive myself if I have a craving.  That\u2019s how I teach my kids about making food choices, and don\u2019t go by a scale (I only know what I weigh when I go to the doctor).
